Just testing tailwind

I'm going to reproduce the front page of [Life of an Architect](https://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/) using only html/css.

Update: The project is finished!

Note : I used tailwindcss CLI and did not include it in the repo because the file is quite large and already hosted on github.

You can find the tailwindcss executable [HERE](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest)
